        <p>
          Lucas conceived Raiders of the the Lost Ark in the early 1970's.
          Seeking to mondernize the serial films of the early 20th-century,
          he developed the idea further with Kaufman, whi suggested the Ark
          as the film's goaal. Lucas eventually focused on developing his 1977
          opera Star Wars.

        <p>
          The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were
          mixed criticizing its darker elements and violence. However, critical
          opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and
          imagination.

        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>
          After a mixed reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,
          Spielberg chose to tone down the dark tone and graphic violence in the
          next installments during the five years between the Temple of Doom
          and The Last Crusade, he and executive producer Lucas reviewed several
          scripts before accepting Jefferey Boam's.
